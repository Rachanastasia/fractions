# Fractions in Java!

## Assignment

> Write the Fraction class according to the specifications in this diagram. Create two constructors, a no-argument constructor and a consstructor that accepts the numerator and denominator. Ensure that all fields are properly encapsulated with getters and setters.

> Include a toString() method that returns a String in the form "numerator/denominator". That is, the Fraction with numerator 1 and denominator 2 should return "1/2".

> The add() method accepts a Fraction object and performs addition of that object and this. You do not have to reduce the resulting Fraction. For example if Fraction a = 1/3 and fraction b = 1/2 then we do the following:

> Make sure the denominators are the same. If they are go to the next step. Otherwise: Multiply both the denominator of a and the numerator of a by the denominator of b giving 2/6. The multiply the numerator and denominator of b by the denominator of a giving 3/6. Now the problem becomes 2/6 + 3/6.

> Simply add the two numerators. 2 + 3 = 5. The answer is the Fraction: 5/6.
